# MongoDB $in operator with empty array returns no results
This bug demonstrates an issue where using the `$in` operator with an empty array in a MongoDB query returns no results, even if the field being queried is not required.  This can lead to unexpected behavior in applications that rely on the `$in` operator for flexible filtering.

## Reproduction
The `bug.js` file contains a simple query that uses the `$in` operator with an empty array.  The query should ideally return all documents in the collection, as the condition is effectively always true. However, MongoDB returns an empty array.

## Solution
The `bugSolution.js` file provides a solution to handle this scenario, using appropriate checks to avoid using `$in` with an empty array.  In this instance, it avoids the query altogether if the array is empty.
